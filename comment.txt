1. This is the XML namespace for the svg elements
2. data:           an array of numbers to chart, one for each wedge of the pie.
    width, height: the size of the SVG graphic (in pixels)
    cx,cy:         the center of the pie
    r:             the radius of the pie
    colors:        an array of HTML color strings, one for each wedge
    labels:        an array of labels to appear in the legend, one for each wedge
    lx,ly:         the upper left corner of the chart legend.
4. Create an <svg> element, and specify pixel size and user coordinates.
5. Add up the data so we know how big the pie is.
6. Figure out how big each slice of pie is. Angles in radians
7. Loop through each slice of the pie.
8. This is where the wedge ends
9. Compute the two points where our wedge intersects the circle.
    These formulas are chosen so that an angle of 0 is at 12 o'clock.
10. A flag for angles larger than half a circle.
    It is required by the SVG arc drawing component.
11. We describe a wedge with an <svg:path> element.
    Notice that we create this with createElementNS()
12. This is a string. It holds the path details.
    A = elliptical Arc
    C = curveto
    H = horizontal lineto
    L = lineto
    M = moveto
    Q = quadratic Bézier curve
    S = smooth curveto
    T = smooth quadratic Bézier curveto
    V = vertical lineto
    Z = closepath
13. Now setting attributes to the <svg:path> element.
14. Set this path.
15. Set the color of the wedge.
16. Outline the wedge in black.
17. The width of the stroke.
18. Add the wedge to the path.
